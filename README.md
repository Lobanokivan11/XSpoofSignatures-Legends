## Features

- Allow any package to spoof their signature
	- Bypass GMS checks
- Make spoofed signature either the sole or first signer
- Spoof only after permission granted
- Compatible with the standardized spoofing mechanic ([ref: microG](https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/tree/master/patches))

## Usage (developers)

XSpoofSignatures supports two methods of spoofing:

- Sole signer [DEFAULT]: spoof to be the only signer on a package
- First signer: spoof to be the first signer on a package (multi signers)
	- Note: this does not work for all signer checks such as GMS

Each package **must** declare and request (at runtime) the `android.permission.FAKE_PACKAGE_SIGNATURE` permission.\
If the permission is not granted then no spoofing will occur.

This module will check for two [`<meta-data>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/meta-data-element) tags for each package that wants
to spoof it's own signature:

- `fake-signature` -> The certificate fingerprint in hex
- `fake-signature-only` (optional, default `true`) -> Refer to "Sole signer" above
